# One Nord
Combines the token colors from [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) with the editor colors from [Nord](https://github.com/nordtheme/visual-studio-code). \
I do not have any intentions of publishing this but you can use it by cloning the repo into `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart VSCode.
